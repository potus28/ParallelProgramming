# ParallelProgramming
Repository that teaches how to program using parallel libraries in Python, Fortran, and C++

The goal of this respository is to provide a simple, easy to understand resource that explains:

  1. How to read, write, and execute parallel programs in popular programming languages for scientific computing
  2. Differences between multiprocessing vs multithreading
  3. Differences between synchronous vs asynchronous operations

While this repository and the example programs are mainly going to be focused towards a scientific programming or data science audience, the concepts learned in this repository can in general be applied to a wide vareity of applications.
